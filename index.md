## Project SINGULARITY : Smart Agent-Based Epidemiological Model Of COVID-19 For Societies With Urban Singularities 

This project will design the **first agent-based epidemiological** model tailored to **Brazilian society** as a first step. Outcomes will contribute to limit uncontrolled epidemiological growth and **reduce the economic burden**. Current established Covid-19 epidemiological models ignore the **uniqueness** of some societies like in Brazil, thus reducing model accuracy in those regions. The smart model will draw on Brazilian urban characteristics to simulate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. This is a first step towards a **flexible modelling approach** that could be tailored to **any specific urban region and their singularities**.

Epidemiological models are fundamental for supporting social and healthcare policies. However, established Covid-19 epidemiological models do not consider the **uniqueness** of Brazilian social and urban organisation and that reduces model accuracy. For example, over 11 million people live in **favelas**, where large families share limited space with no sanitation. Current Covid-19 models **fail to predict** how the disease will spread in these regions. Our project will build upon existing models by adding demographic, environmental, and economical features that are singular to Brazil, thus providing policymakers with a useful tool to **support decision making**.

Our project will develop an epidemiological model adapted for Brazilian social, urban, and environmental reality. We expect this model will be used as **reference by local authorities** to **support critical healthcare and economic decisions**, such as social isolation policies, intensive-care allocation, health equipment purchases, etc. As far as we are aware, no model has considered how COVID-19 will spread in poor, dense, tropical scenario. Thus, our project will be relevant to **other countries in the DAC** list that share some or all of these characteristics from Brazil.
